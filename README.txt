QTilities is a component of a solution to import and explore quad-camera
'VOD' videos recorded on an industrial recorder sold by Brigade.
QTilities is an API encapsulating the QuickTime C
API, providing higher-level functions and a bridge to the Modula-2
language. These components are written in a mix of C, C++ and ObjC and
are available on Mac OS X and MS Windows. QTilsM2 is the Modula-2 side
of the QTility bridge and is used in QTVODm2. This is a video player
written in Modula-2 that allows to explore the VOD videos recorded on
the INRETS/IFSTTAR instrumented motorcycles by presenting the 4 camera
views in linked individual windows, laid out on the screen in a relevant
and natural configuration. It can be controlled from a companion
application via a TCP/IP protocol so that it provides the real-world
context for dynamic data (speed, accelerations, rider actions etc.)
recorded while riding the instrumented motorcycles.
